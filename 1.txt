** Copy by value **
1. does only copy of value
   Ex: var a = 2;
       var b = a;
       b = 3;
       console.log(a, b) //2, 3
2. Here changing value of b value does not affect a

** Copy by reference **
1. does copy address and value
   Ex: var arr = [1, [2, 3]];
       var arr1 = arr;
       arr[1][2] = 4;
       console.log(arr, arr1) //[1, [2, 3, 4]], [1, [2, 3, 4]]
2. Here changing value of arr has affected arr1.
